# ConvolutionCPP
An investigation project concerning convolution in cpp.

## Possible applications
For this course we will build three applications which implement convolution. All three of the apps will be able to import an IR file into a buffer to use as the source of the convolution.
1. Microphone reverb: Connecting the input stream to the convolution (Use headphones).
2. File playback: Import an audio file (mp3/wav) in a buffer and play it using convolution.
3. Research: fast convolution vs direct convolution

## Status
- [x] Week 1: Pitch the idea (pitch 1)
- [ ] Week 2: Pitch what we are trying to accomplish, now with research (pitch 2)
